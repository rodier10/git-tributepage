        <p id="tribute-info"><span class="highlight">Marcus Aurelius</span> was <span class="highlight">Roman emperor</span> from 161 to 180 and a <span class="highlight">Stoic philosopher.</span> 
            He was a member of the <span class="highlight">Nervaâ€“Antonine dynasty</span>, the last of the rulers later known as the 
            <span class="highlight">Five Good Emperors</span> and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace, 
            calm, and stability for the Roman Empire lasting from 27 BC to 180 AD. He served as 
            <span class="highlight">Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161.</span></p>

        <p id="tribute-info"><span class="highlight">Marcus Aurelius</span> was the <span class="highlight">son of the praetor Marcus Annius Verus</span> and his wife, 
          <span class="highlight">Domitia Calvilla.</span> He was related through marriage to the emperors <span class="highlight">Trajan and Hadrian.</span> Marcus's 
          father <span class="highlight">died</span> when he was three, and he <span class="highlight">was raised by his mother and paternal grandfather.</span> After 
          Hadrian's adoptive son, <span class="highlight">Aelius Caesar</span>, died in 138, Hadrian adopted Marcus's uncle <span class="highlight">Antoninus Pius</span> 
          as his new heir. In turn, Antoninus adopted <span class="highlight">Marcus and Lucius</span>, the son of <span class="highlight">Aelius.</span> Hadrian died that 
          year, and Antoninus became emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek and Latin under 
          tutors such as <span class="highlight">Herodes Atticus and Marcus Cornelius Fronto.</span> He married Antoninus's daughter 
          <span class="highlight">Faustina</span> in 145.</p>

          <ul id="tribute-timeline">
            <li>Marcus was born in Rome on 26 April 121.</li>
            <li>From a young age, Marcus displayed enthusiasm for wrestling and boxing.</li>
            <li>One of his teachers, Diognetus, a painting master, proved particularly influential; 
              he seems to have introduced Marcus Aurelius to the philosophic way of life.</li>
            <li>As quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do.</li>
            <li> He had three tutors in Greek (Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and Herodes Atticus) 
              and one in Latin (Marcus Cornelius Fronto).</li>
            <li> Although educated in Rome, in his Meditations Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.</li>
            <li>Like many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing 
              disputes, but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.</li>
            <li>He died of illness after his last battle. All that is recorded in the Vita of the Emperors of Rome is that, prior to his death, 
              he opted not to eat nor drink, as if testing his own humanity to end up welcoming death.</li>
          </ul>
